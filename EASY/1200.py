# 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference

# Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

# Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

#     a, b are from arr
#     a < b
#     b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr

        arr.sort()
        diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            diff = min(diff, arr[i + 1] - arr[i])
        
        res = []

            if arr[i + 1] - arr[i] == diff:
                res.append([arr[i], arr[i + 1]])
