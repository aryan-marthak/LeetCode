# 344. Reverse String

# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

# You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
