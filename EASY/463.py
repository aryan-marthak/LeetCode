# 463. Island Perimeter

# You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

# The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        peri = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    peri += 4
                    if j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 1:
                        peri -= 2
                    if i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] == 1:
                        peri -= 2
        return peri
