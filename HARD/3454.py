// 3454. Separate Squares II

//You are given a 2D integer array squares. Each squares[i] = [xi, yi, li] represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.

//Find the minimum y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line equals the total area covered by squares below the line.

//Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

//Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.
