# 3650. Minimum Cost Path with Edge Reversals

# You are given a directed, weighted graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents a directed edge from node ui to node vi with cost wi.

# Each node ui has a switch that can be used at most once: when you arrive at ui and have not yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges vi → ui reverse that edge to ui → vi and immediately traverse it.

# The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs 2 * wi.

# Return the minimum total cost to travel from node 0 to node n - 1. If it is not possible, return -1.
