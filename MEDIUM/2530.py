# 2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations

# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.

# In one operation:

#     choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length,
#     increase your score by nums[i], and
#     replace nums[i] with ceil(nums[i] / 3).

# Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly k operations.

# The ceiling function ceil(val) is the least integer greater than or equal to val.

        res = 0
        maxheap = [-i for i in nums]
        heapq.heapify(maxheap)
        while k:
            temp = -heapq.heappop(maxheap)
            res += temp
            k -= 1
            heapq.heappush(maxheap, - math.ceil(temp / 3))
        return res
