# 75. Sort Colors

# Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

# We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

# You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:

        # bubble sort


        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] > nums[j + 1]:
                    nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]
