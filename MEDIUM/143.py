# 143. Reorder List

# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

# Reorder the list to be on the following form:

# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
