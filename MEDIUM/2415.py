# 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree

# Given the root of a perfect binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

#     For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are [2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18], then it should become [18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2].

# Return the root of the reversed tree.

# A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

# The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
