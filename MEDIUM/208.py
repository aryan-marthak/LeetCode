# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

# A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

# Implement the Trie class:

#     Trie() Initializes the trie object.
#     void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
#     boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
#     boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        curr = self.root
        for i in word:
            if i not in curr.children:
                curr.children[i] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[i]
        curr.end = True
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for i in word:
            if i not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[i]
        return curr.end
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for i in prefix:
            if i not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[i]
        return True 


# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
