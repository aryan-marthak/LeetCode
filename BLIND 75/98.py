# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

# A valid BST is defined as follows:

#     The left 

# of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def helper(node, left, right):
            if not node:
                return True
            if not (left < node.val < right):
                return False
            return helper(node.left, left, node.val) and helper(node.right, node.val, right)
        return helper(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
